### Sample Rails App
Generate a rails app to show airplane data using the following guidelines: 

* Use the provided `airplanes.csv` to populate your DB however you see fit. (hint: "seed")
* You do not need to style any pages
* From the web interface, the user should be able to: 
  1. create a new airplane
  2. see all existing airplanes
  3. delete an airplane
* You do not need to worry about Authentication or Permissions.
